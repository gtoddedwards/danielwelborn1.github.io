"Ahhh... I see the fuck-up fairy has visited us again.."
"I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce."
"How about never? Is never good for you?"
"I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public."
"I'm really easy to get along with once you people learn to worship me."
"I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter."
"I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message.."
"I don't work here. I'm a consultant."
"It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're saying."
"I can see your point, but I still think you're full of shit."
"I like you. You remind me of me when I was young and stupid."
"You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers."
"I have plenty of talent and vision. I just don't give a damn."
"I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth."
"I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you."

"Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental."
"What am I? Flypaper for freaks!?"
"I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant."
"It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off."
"Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial."
"No, my powers can only be used for good."
"You sound reasonable... Time to up the medication."
"Who me? I just wander from room to room."
